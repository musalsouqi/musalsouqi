# 👋 Hi, I'm Mustafa

I'm a Computer Science student based just outside of Chicago, IL, graduating in Auguest 2026. I’m focused on becoming a software developer and building scalable, well-structured systems.

I have experience working with:

* **Java**
* **C++**
* **Python**
* **JavaScript**
* **C#**
* Lua

I enjoy designing systems from the ground up, applying object-oriented principles, and writing clean, maintainable code. Most of my projects focus on backend logic, game systems, and full application structure rather than just surface-level features.
