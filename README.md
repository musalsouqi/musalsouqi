I'm Mustafa

ðŸ˜„ - I'm a current Computer Science student based just outside of Chicago, IL. I have experience in various programming languages, with a strong focus on Java, C++, and Python. While studying, I've been working on diverse projects, ranging from web development to app creation. I'm always eager to learn and create new things.

ðŸŒ± - I've developed a calorie-counting app, multiple websites, and even a Minecraft mod that introduces a new ore. My school projects have also given me a solid foundation in software development. 

âš¡ - One of my recent projects was a Text based game written in javascript. It was a fun and educational experience.
